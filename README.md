## Features

This base project comes pre-configured with the following features and modules:

- **State Management:** Integrated state management solution (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Bloc) for efficient data handling and UI updates.
> Specify the state management solution used. Example: Provider
- **Navigation:** Pre-configured navigation system for seamless screen transitions.
> Specify the navigation approach used. Example: `go_router`
- **Theming:** Customizable theming support for consistent styling across the application. Includes light and dark theme options.
- **Localization:** Internationalization (i18n) setup for supporting multiple languages.
- **API Integration:** Ready-to-use API client for interacting with backend services.
> Mention the HTTP client library used. Example: `dio`
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling mechanism for managing exceptions and displaying user-friendly error messages.
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging system for debugging and monitoring application behavior.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and run the application.

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version >= 3.0.0)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Flutter extension
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development)
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or other modern browser (for Web development)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:


    API_URL=https://api.example.com
    1.  Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
2.  Run the application:

    bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    The project follows a modular architecture to promote code reusability and maintainability.

### Directory Structure

-   `main.dart`: Initializes the Flutter application and sets up the root widget.
-   `core/`: Contains core functionalities and reusable components used throughout the application.
-   `features/`: Organizes the application's features into separate modules, each with its own presentation, data, and domain layers.
-   `config/`: Defines the application's configuration, such as routes, themes, and localization settings.
-   `widgets/`: Contains reusable UI components that can be used across different features.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

-   **Problem:** `flutter pub get` fails.
    **Solution:** Ensure you have the latest version of the Flutter SDK installed and that your Flutter environment is correctly configured.
-   **Problem:** iOS build fails due to code signing issues.
    **Solution:** Configure code signing in Xcode by selecting a development team and provisioning profile.
-   **Problem:** Application crashes on startup.
    **Solution:** Check the logs for any error messages or exceptions. Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed and configured.
